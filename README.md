# WrayzorSharp-3PasswordGenerator

ðŸ’¡The goal was to create an application for the user to generate a unique secure password. The application is to allow customisation to the potential password in the way of variable length and being able to select and deselect differnet character groups.

The stater index.html and script.js were both edited and added to extensively, firstly assigning separate character groups to arrays as variables to allow access to each type separately; coding a form for the password parameters (length and character types); effectively referencing the form inputs in the script.js and assigning as variables icluding a resultant array concatenating arrays from all selected in the form; and finally a for-loop generating the password to be printed to the user.
